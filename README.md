# Portfolio-Website
This website is my web developer portfolio. It is intended to showcase work
that I have been involved in and show what I can offer to potential clients.

## Requirements

* Python 2.7
* Django  


## Settings

The settings file does not get pushed to git since it contains sensitive data.
Make sure you have the correct list of installed apps:

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'home',
    'page_analyser',
]
